            <p>Hello and welcome to Taief. Taief is an online role-playing game conducted entirely through email. Unlike other MMOs, Taief is limited only by your imagination. Want to build a magnificent castle and conquer the globe? You can do that. Want to build a nuclear weapon and launch it down the throat of one of your rivals? You can do that too. In Taief you'll encounter both other players, and NPCs controlled by me, Timalick, your Game Master.</p>

            <p>Taief is a text based game, and you can expect to feel a bit confused at times. While starting off can seem slow or frustrating, you'll find that the more you seek to accomplish, the more progression you'll make. Unlike other games in this genre, Taief doesn't come with a rule-book, so nothing is off limits. Every email response you receive will be custom built specifically for you and depending on the circumstances, you may receive image attachments or links to videos like the one above to better understand the mechanics of the game. You decide the actions that your character takes, we tell you what happens next. It is the ultimate immersive experience and will always be free to play.</p>

            <p>There's only one question remaining, are you ready to start your adventure? Fill out the form below and try to keep it realistic, if you build the perfect apocalypse survivor as a character, I will assign you negative traits, if you build a total weakling, I will assign you positive ones. If you're lacking imagination, base your character off of yourself and get ready to step into the ultimate fantasy. You'll receive your first update within 24-hours.</p>
